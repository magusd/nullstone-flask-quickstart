# flask-hello-world

This is a Hello World example for [Nullstone](https://nullstone.io).

This is based on the Flask official [quickstart guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/).
However, we have extended to include `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` so that you can run this locally in docker.
